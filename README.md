Change for Kids creates opportunities for kids.

[Change The Future]

We provide critical supports, experiences, and access so kids in New York City public schools can reimagine their possibilities and overcome inequity. We believe opportunities create options.

And this affords them the tools to reimagine their own possibilities and the tools with which to overcome inequity.

# Our Work


## The CFK Model

The Change for Kids community works together to allow young people to see themselves in the future with unlimited options. CFK School Managers, in partnership with principals, teachers, and CFK leadership, identify the needs of each CFK partner school.

Together, we provide and manage a mix of resources, including leadership support; academic enrichment and engagement programs; volunteers; corporate sponsors; school community support; and custom programming.


## Change For Kids Custom Programs

### TALNT Academy 
A new CFK initiative designed to intersect arts education with social-emotional learning (SEL). 
TALNT brings arts instruction with an intentional social-emotional learning focus into schools to help students creatively channel their energy while being coached by working professionals in the arts. 

### School Beautification
CFK transform school environments from dreary to bright and functional for a real impact on student engagement. At our CFK School Beautification Days, we bring talented, recognized muralists into the schools to visually amplify the culture and mission of each school, and volunteers make spaces into inspiring learning environments where students love to learn.  

### De-escalation Rooms
Our schools have asked for multi-sensory de-escalation rooms. De-escalation rooms give our students a space to de-escalate from an overly stressed or emotional state safely, reducing the chance of physical injury to themselves or others around them. Many of our students live in transitional housing, single-parent homes, or abusive environments. Families can struggle to fulfill their basic needs, such as food and shelter. Some schools have a high percentage of their student population diagnosed with learning and behavioral disabilities, who struggle with coping and self-regulation.  Add the stress of their daily existence - teachers being shot, parents being abused, parents whose energy must go towards self-preservation in lieu of consistent parenting.
Our schools train staff members in de-escalation tactics to help a stressed student regain control and regulate their emotions.The goal is to teach the students to be able to do this on their own, and long-term, for the students to be able to signal to the teacher when they are approaching crisis mode and need a safe space to de-escalate.

### Reading Buddies
Volunteers visit classrooms during literacy blocks to read aloud to a small group or full class, then engage them in a lively discussion about what they've read together.  These sessions provide students with additional opportunities to improve their comprehension skills, fire up their imaginations, and make text-to-self connections. Students are excited to see new faces in their classroom and love hearing a favorite story told by new people. 

### Graduating to Greatness
The CFK Graduating to Greatness program is a critical part of preparing students for success beyond elementary school. A multi-year, multi-event series of workshops help students and their parents navigate the middle school application process. 

### Resource Drives
Our schools serve as a critical hub of their communities. One of the most fulfilling ways we partner with schools is bringing that community to life, especially during holidays, with meals, gifts, and winter clothing where it's needed. Based on the needs of the school, CFK engages its extended network to support specific needs of the school community. Drives can have ripple effects - a coat drive at one of our schools was the unlikely solution to increase attendance during the freezing winter months.

### Parent University
Parent University is a series of workshops and activities for parents on how to support their children's learning while empowering them to pursue personal goals. CFK also provides volunteers during workshop times to facilitate activities for students to alleviate child care concerns so parents can focus.

### Financial Literacy
Financial literacy is an important tool to introduce financial capability to our scholars, their parents or caregivers, and our school communities. CFK scholars are taught basic principles and practices on how to manage money - both at home and in school.

### Experience NY
CFK's Experience NY enrichment program enables students and their families to experience museums, Broadway and off-Broadway shows, dance recitals, music concerts, and corporate business offices.

## Impact

The Change for Kids approach makes a positive impact on the lives of nearly 5,000 students at 13 partner schools in all five boroughs. With the help of supporters like you, Change for Kids raised $1.7 million this past year to combat educational inequity in New York City. This funded 57,833 programming hours and 115 volunteer events - that's over 4,700 volunteer hours dedicated to students. 80% of students in Change for Kids partner schools received new coats, winter accessories, or gifts during the 2018 holiday season. With an equal focus on academics, social-emotional learning, and community engagement, CFK truly does make change for kids. 

## 25 Years of Change for Kids

Twenty-five years ago in 1994, Ted Madara, a “finance guy,” was at a bar and got into a discussion with a teacher who casually mentioned that each drink he ordered cost more than what was in the budget for her kids’ school supplies for a year. 

Ted immediately realized this was something he could - and should - change. 

He could help meet a basic need of kids in public schools. He saw that even small change could have a big impact, and encouraged the people in his network to donate their spare change to help purchase school supplies for a public school classroom. 

> That’s how Change for Kids was founded.

Receiving incredible support from his network, Madara eventually incorporated as a nonprofit in 1996, and partnered with four elementary schools in New York City. In one of the schools, the team discovered 30 violins in a closet. [Someone - WHO?] raised their hand to underwrite a teacher and curriculum, and suddenly 50 kids had music lessons. Today, 500 kids at four schools study music because of Change for Kids. 

In 2008, in the midst of the stock market crash and facing serious economic challenges, funding for Change for Kids dropped drastically. Colin Smith, a member of the Change for Kids Board of Directors, stepped up to become the Executive Director, and led the organization through a mission restructure, as well as grew funding from $79,000 to $367,000 in the course of one year. 

Over the course of the next few years, Change for Kids grew from a school-supply driven organization, to one with a strategic approach to partnership, with a focus on delivering targeted services, developing the role of the School Manager, and creating a vision for sustainability.  By 2017, CFK's budget had grown to approximately $2,000,000, with a robust staff of School Managers, Development & Communications professionals, and strong executive leadership. Our corporate partners have become Super Heroes to the 5,000 kids we serve together. For example, Gensler designers worked tirelessly to turn Grant Avenue Elementary School's “scary science room” into a beautiful collaboration space for teachers. Every Thanksgiving, RBC provides 40+ families with a bountiful Thanksgiving meal. This past year, Nordstrom provided 1,000 students with coats through our partnership with Operation Warm.

Today, Kevin Ervin sits at the helm of Change for Kids.  A visionary leader hailing from Brooklyn, NY, Kevin has years of experience in youth development, and is fully committed to providing the critical supports, experiences, and access necessary so kids can reimagine their possibilities and overcome inequity. Under Kevin's leadership, Change for Kids is primed to direct our resources, efficiently and effectively, to meet the acute needs of potentially 492 schools.  

Change for Kids can change the future. We’re so excited for what the next 25 years will hold.

Let’s Catch Kids Being Good, and Reinforce Their Positive Choices.
May 10, 2019 changeforkids

> Mental health is equally as important as physical health, and each can affect the other in myriad ways. However, there is still a stigma surrounding mental health and the open discussion and treatment thereof. If you felt sick, or you thought your ankle might be sprained, or you seemed to be having an allergic reaction, you wouldn’t hesitate to go to the doctor and treat those issues impacting your physical health – why should mental health be any different?

Volunteers inspire, coach and mentor our students, and enrich our school communities.

> This is National Volunteer Month, a time that always makes me reflect on how grateful I am for the volunteers that helped me learn, who shaped my determination to make a difference for kids into my choice as a career. I originally got involved in volunteer work because of the impact it had on me as a child. I saw that positive role models cared about my well being, my education, and my future. Volunteers can serve as a catalyst to demonstrate to children that there are multiple ways to escape the cycle of poverty, inequity, and despair. Children have the future in their hands, and being someone who can help them mold that future is what the volunteers in our schools provide.
